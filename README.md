## Introduction to 3D Morphology with 3D Slicer and SlicerMorph
SlicerMorph Short Course at USP

### Course Prerequisites

If you do not already have them, please obtain accounts at:
* https://github.com
* https://morphosource.org
* https://orcid.org.
  
GitHub and ORCID are mandatory to use MorphoCloud. MorphoSource account is required, if you want to be able to download data (you can search for data without an account). 
  
Also you will **need a 3-button mouse (cannot emphasize this enough)** to operate 3D Slicer (or any other 3D software) effectively. 

### MorphoCloud On Demand
Through the course we will test our cloud platform, MorphoCloud On Demand that provides powerful computers and GPUs to handle large datasets. Once you obtain the necessary accounts, to go https://instances.morpho.cloud, read the document about how MorphoCloud operates, and then use the provided link to request an instance. 

### Resources to use through out the course:
